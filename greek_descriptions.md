# Option Greek Descriptions

## What are Option Greeks?
Option Greeks are financial measures of the sensitivity of an option's price to its underlying asset's price, volatility and other parameters.  The Greeks are used to analyze an option portfolio's risk and assist in position management, as well as pricing.

The main option greeks that are most often used are:
- Delta - Measure of sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset's price
- Gamma - Measure of the delta's change relative to changes in the price of the underlying asset
- Theta - Measure of the option price decay over time
- Vega - Measure of the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset's price
